Noddity Retrieval
=====

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/TehShrike/noddity-retrieval.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This module provides an API to a [Noddity](http://noddity.com) data store full of posts and a list of said posts.

You give it an http(s) root, and that's all it needs to provide

- an async getter function to download parsed post objects
- an async getter function to download an array of post objects based on the index.json file from the root directory


So I have this idea, right?  Where your blog posts could just be a directory with an index file and a bunch of markdown files, just being served out onto the internet.

The idea is that your root directory of posts contains:

- An index.json file, containing a JSON array of strings representing the file names that are your "official" blog posts, in order.
- Whatever markdown files you want to be accessible, with metadata stored in a format amenable to [text-metadata-parser](https://github.com/TehShrike/text-metadata-parser).

Usage
-----

```js
var retrieve = new Retrieve('http://remote-server.com/blogfiles/')

retrieve.getIndex(function(err, index) {
	if (!err && index.length > 0) {
		// Get the most recent post
		retrieve.getPost(index.pop(), function(err, post) {
			console.log("Found post named " + post.metadata.title)
			console.log("The words inside it are:\n" + post.content)
		})
	}
})

```

This is the core module of the [Noddity](http://noddity.com/) cms.
